    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Proactive and analytical junior tester with a solid technical foundation gained from leading European universities. Holding an MSc in Management in Production and a BSc in Mechanics and Building Machines, I bring a diverse skill set and a strong grasp of technical and business concepts. My academic journey, including studies at DTU, sharpened my abilities in project management, strategy, and organizational methods. Driven by a passion for software testing, I successfully completed the Sourcery Academy by Cognizant, where I gained hands-on experience in Agile, Functional and Non-functional testing, Automation, Performance, Security, and Exploratory testing. I am skilled in testing foundation and SQL. With excellent English communication skills and a commitment to continuous learning, I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to contribute to quality assurance efforts with optimism and
Precision.
